# Tic_tac_toe_game_project


✨ I’m excited to share a personal project I recently completed: a Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely using Core Java! 🎮

This project helped me strengthen my skills in Java programming and deepened my understanding of object-oriented concepts and game logic.

🔍 Key Features:

Two-player mode: Playable by two players locally, with simple console-based interaction.
Game logic: Implementation of rules such as win condition checks, player turns, and board updates.
Easy-to-use interface: Simple text-based interface displayed on the console.
Clear instructions: Prompts guiding players on how to make their move and track the game progress.
Reset functionality: Restart the game at any point to start a new session.
💡 What I Learned:

Enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Worked with 2D arrays to manage the game board and check win conditions.
Focused on error handling and ensuring the game responds gracefully to invalid inputs.
Improved my skills in data structures and algorithms while working on efficient ways to track player moves and determine the winner.
🌟 Technologies Used:

Core Java (JDK 8+)
Java classes and methods
Arrays for managing game state
This project has been a great way to sharpen my Java skills and I’m eager to explore more complex applications in the future.
